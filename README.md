 # Tales of Cheat Engine tables

These tables were originally meant to be for myself, but I am releasing all of them here. Not all of them are usable tables, and only contain notes, perhaps someone wants to look at them. Below I will list each table's features. Note that unless you use the exact version of the game I posted, things might not work.
